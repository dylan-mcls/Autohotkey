# Autohotkey
My Public Autohotkey scripts for my work PC.

## Scripts

### AIO Virtual Desktop (AIOVD)
I wanted to use the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000's special keys to send CTRL + WIN + Left/Right to quickly switch between Virtual Desktops. This proved to be achievable with [PolarGoose's ahk script](https://github.com/PolarGoose/AutoHotKey-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000-support) with minor edits on my end.

Somewhere Along the way I also started running [Sdias Win 10 Virtual Desktop Enhancer](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer) side by side.

AIOVD is a very simple modification to both ahk scripts so that they can run in tandom with a single compiled ahk file, rather than 2. This allows me to assign keys to the Natural 4000 Keyboard while still having the Virtual Desktop Enhancer functionality.
